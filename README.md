## 🎯 Problem Statement

-Problem: Unwanted spam messages clutter SMS inboxes, making it difficult for users to find important messages and posing potential security risks.

-Objective: Develop a machine learning model that can automatically identify and classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate, ensuring a clean and secure messaging experience for users.

-Challenge: Accurately distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages in a highly imbalanced dataset with varying text content, while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## Project Overview 

SMS Spam Classifier provides a comprehensive analysis of SMS Detector data. 
It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract valuable insights from conversations.

<br>

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Analysis

1. **📥 Import SMS Detector Data**: Begin by importing the WhatsApp chat data from the text file you exported.

2. **🧹 Text Preprocessing**: Perform text preprocessing to ensure data accuracy and consistency

3. **🧬 Data Transformation**: Transform the cleaned data into a structured format for analysis. 

4. **📊 Metrics Calculation**: Calculate relevant metrics.

5. **💾 Save Cleaned Data**: Save the cleaned and structured data for further analysis.

<br>

### 📊 Data Visualization

- Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations.
- Generated bar plots, line charts, heatmaps, and more to illustrate trends and patterns.
- Visualizations provide a clear representation of user engagement, content popularity, and viewing habits.

### 🛠️ User Manual

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook ('sms-detector.ipynb') in a compatible environment.
- Follow along with the documented steps to understand the EDA process.
- Experiment with the code and visualizations to gain insights.
- Feel free to modify and adapt the code for your own analysis.

## 🤔 Challenges Faced

- **Data Variety**: Handling diverse data types, including numerical, date-based, and categorical, posed data preprocessing challenges.

- **Data Volume**: Analyzing a large dataset required efficient memory management and processing techniques.

- **Data Quality**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies was critical for accurate analysis.

<br>

## 💡 Insights Derived

**False Positives and Negatives**:Identifying instances where legitimate messages are incorrectly classified as spam (false positives) or spam messages are missed (false negatives).
**Deployment Insights**:Observations and challenges encountered during the deployment of the spam classifier as a real-time or batch processing system.
